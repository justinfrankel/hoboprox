HOBOprox persistent IRC proxy

This is a tool I wrote and used from 2009-201? (I forget - our switch to Slack made this a bit unneeded) in order to allow persistent IRC connections. It would run between the IRC client and an IRC server, and bring the IRC client up to date on everything you missed when you connected. It would keep track of the reading position of each client by the username field, etc. Multiple users are supported (assuming the IRC server permits such). Eventually I added a web interface to it, too. It's probably not useful for anybody, but better to preserve this sort of thing than to let it disappear.
